# cric_score
Code was written in " cric_score.py " file.
updating scores match by match..
with using match wise ball by ball data in csv format,I created stats of each player from https://cricsheet.org/downloads/.
Intially I took only ODI matches played by India,
By executing we will see match wise highlights includes,50's,100's,wickets,landmarks achieved in that match and landmarks that are gonna be achieved by specific player
I took data of 3 matches and put another match as in comments for testing.
